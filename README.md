Repository where I code the concepts of large language models from scratch

For my reference, I am following the book "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka.

## Progress

The repository contains the implementation of concepts that are necessary to build a large language model from scratch. The progress is as follows:
- [x] Coded attention mechanism
- [x] Coded activation functions (ReLU and GeLU)
- [x] Coded feedforward neural network
- [x] Coded layerNorm
- [x] Coded transformer block
- [x] Coded GPT model
